            <h2 >My Background</h2>
            <p>
                I was born and grew up in a city called Gondar, 
                a place rich in history and culture. I completed 
                my education there, attending school from kindergarten 
                up to grade 9. Throughout my upbringing, I was surrounded
                 by a wonderful family and friends who have supported me in
                  every step of my journey.

            <h2 >My Achievment</h2>
            <p>
                Throughout my journey, I have been fortunate to achieve several milestones
                 that I am proud of. One of my significant accomplishments was participating 
                 in the Ethiopian Spelling Bee competition alongside my best friend, where 
                 I earned a medal for my performance.
