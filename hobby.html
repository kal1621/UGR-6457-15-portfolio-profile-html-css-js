    <p>
        Hobbies are a wonderful way to express creativity and enjoy life outside of work. Here are some of my favorite hobbies.

        <p><small>My favorite animation movie</small></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Watching Animation Movies:I have a deep appreciation for animation films, as they combine art, 
                storytelling, and creativity in unique ways. Whether it's a classic Disney film or a modern anime,
                 I enjoy the diverse styles and themes that animation offers. These movies not only entertain me
                  but also inspire my imagination and often convey meaningful messages that resonate with audiences 
                  of all ages.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>Decorating My House:I find joy in creating a beautiful living space through home decoration. 
                I love experimenting with different styles, colors, and arrangements to make my home a reflection 
                of my personality. Whether it's rearranging furniture, adding decorative items, or choosing the
                 right lighting, I enjoy the process of transforming a space into a warm and inviting environment. 
                 This hobby allows me to express my creativity while also providing a sense of comfort and 
                 tranquility in my daily life.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Listening to Mezmur:I enjoy listening to mezmure. This genre of music, which often features spiritual 
                and uplifting themes, resonates with my emotions and provides a sense of peace and reflection. I find
                that listening to mezmure helps me relax, boosts my mood, and connects me to my cultural roots. 
                Whether I'm studying, relaxing at home, or driving, mezmure is often the soundtrack to my day.</li>
